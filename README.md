# Portfolio_Construction_Design
The portfolio website project is a prototype designed by me using HTML, CSS Flexbox and JavaScript. I focused on simple technologies to create a responsive page. 
The content written in it, as professional experience and jobs developed is just an illustration.

## What is it?
This Portfolio Website is divided into five HTML pages connected between them, such as home, portfolio, sobre mim, blog, contato.

## How does it work?

### HOME:
That is the first page you will see, right here you can get starting the site navigation. Scrolling to see more information, links, latest blog news, projects developed and very cool CSS efects.
Pay attention on-page behavior, 3D words show up and fade out as soon as you scroll the page down. You may notice words floating within a small space.
As soon as you put the focus on blog subtitles, an interactive box appears moving the highlight up to down.

### SOBRE MIM:
Here you can get some information about me like personal skills developed, how I use to do my work, jobs I've made, the knowledge I've got throw my career and technologies that I work.
There are two interactive blocquote, so when the pointer is over them, it increases the object's scale and a shadow spreads over the rest of the page.

### PORTFOLIO:
In this section, companies are positioned using CSS Flexbox, stressing one of the jobs on the top of the layout.

In the blog, a tiny preview in advance of the content gives an idea of the subject covered before access the whole text.
